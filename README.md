# Word-Frequency-Analysis

Developed and implemented a text parsing algorithm in C++ by using binary search tree to analyze a large text file, producing an exact word frequency count for each word in the file.

Read and analyzed texts from the novels of 1200+ pages using file input capability allowed for the study of complete books and the provision of thorough summaries for each analysis.

Designed an intuitive user interface that allows users to input a word and retrieve its frequency, and export the frequency analysis to a file for further examination.
